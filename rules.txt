In this version of hangman, you will be able to select a word from 3 difficulties.

You will be able to guess the word one letter at a time; or, if you're feeling confident, you can guess the whole word entirely.

Every time you enter a letter that doesn't exist within the word or enter an incorrect word, an element of the hangman drawing will be added.

Once the hangman drawing is complete, you will lose the game.

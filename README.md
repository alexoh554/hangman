# hangman
C++ classic "hangman" game run in console.

## Description
In hangman, your task is to correctly guess a word randomly chosen by the computer. Your guess may be a single letter, or it may be the word itself. As you make incorrect guesses, you will see the drawing of hangman progress. Once the hangman is complete, you have lost the game.

This project includes a dynamic word bank. Any words added to the txt files in the "static" folder will be included in the computer's word selection process.
